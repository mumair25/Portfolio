                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I’m Muhammad Umair, a passionate Software Engineer and Web Developer. I specialize in building dynamic and user-friendly websites using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and back-end frameworks.

                    I enjoy solving complex problems through clean and efficient code, always focusing on creating seamless user experiences. I am constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in the fast-evolving tech industry.
                    
                    When I’m not coding, I love exploring new tools, contributing to open-source projects, and collaborating with others on innovative ideas.
                    
                    Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or work together!
